# Dhall Configs

This repository serves as a collection of [Dhall][0] files that are to be used by other Dhall files as imports.

At the time of writing (`2021-04-29`), the sole use of this is to share common "interfaces" for config files, such as APIs written [with Koa][1] since they require a standard group of settings for them to function how I expect.
